The pen is mightier than the sword. This means that words can be more powerful than weapons. For example, a well-written speech can persuade people to take action, while a poorly written article can spread misinformation.
A stitch in time saves nine. This means that it is better to fix a small problem before it becomes a big problem. For example, if you notice a hole in your shirt, it is better to sew it up immediately than to wait until the hole gets bigger and the shirt becomes unwearable.
Curiosity killed the cat. This means that being too curious can be dangerous. For example, if you see a strange animal in the woods, it is best to leave it alone. You don't know if it is dangerous or not.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. This means that you should not risk everything on one thing. For example, if you are investing your money, you should spread it out over different investments so that you don't lose everything if one investment goes bad.
Rome wasn't built in a day. This means that it takes time to achieve great things. For example, if you want to learn a new language, don't expect to be fluent overnight. It will take time and practice.
